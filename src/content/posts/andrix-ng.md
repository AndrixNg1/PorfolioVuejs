👋 About Me
===========

I’m **Andrix Ngoyi**, a passionate **Software Engineer** dedicated to crafting innovative digital solutions that blend performance, simplicity, and human-centered design.  
I specialize in building modern web applications with **Vue.js**, **Next.js**, and **TailwindCSS**, focusing on clarity, scalability, and impact.  

I believe great software starts with great intention.  
Each project I build is driven by the idea of creating tools that not only solve problems but **empower people** and **bring ideas to life**.

Beyond coding, I explore emerging technologies, refine my craft, and collaborate with creative minds to build systems that last.  
For me, **technology is a language** — and I aim to speak it fluently, meaningfully, and with purpose.


⚙️ My Philosophy
================

> “Every line of code is a statement of intent — make it clean, make it count.”

My philosophy as a developer revolves around three essential principles:

1. **Clarity** — Code should be elegant, understandable, and maintainable.  
2. **Performance** — Software should be fast, efficient, and built for scale.  
3. **Experience** — Every product should engage, guide, and inspire users.

I don’t chase complexity.  
I chase **efficiency**, **precision**, and **real-world results**.  
Because in the end, the best engineering isn’t about how clever your code looks — it’s about how well it serves its purpose.
